"""The Cookbook's backend, where a task is called finished.

A download that exits zero is done — the poll used to leave it "running"
forever — and a dependency probe has to refresh the user-site view or a
package that was just installed still reads as missing. The parts of this
that used to live in the browser moved into the interface's own modules and
are pinned there.
